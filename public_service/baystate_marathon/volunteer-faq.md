We will have a cross-band repeater in operation for this event. It will be in
Chelmsford. Program your radio for it using a SIMPLEX frequency of `446.025`
and a PL of `74.4`. It is repeating what it hears and transmits it on the
`BAYSTATE1` frequency. If you transmit on the `446.025` PL `74.4` frequency,
you will be heard on `BAYSTATE1`. This crossband function may assist to on the
course locations to communicate with us at the UCC located at the foot of the
Rourke Bridge. **THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO TSONGAS CIRCLE LOCATIONS!**

## What sort of radio do I need?

You ONLY Need an HT. A 5 watt HT should be sufficient. Bring extra battery
packs just in case. Some of you may be able to operate out of your vehicle,
check out the options once you check in with the water stop team and see what
the parking situation looks like.

## Besides a radio, what should I bring with me?

Bring your own food, drink, and camp/collapsible chair. I would recommend you
bring a clipboard with the "tracking" form we have used in the past. Don't
forget a writing utensil.

Dress for the weather and consider that you will spend most of your time
sitting still. If the weather is supposed to be on the cooler side, make sure
you have sufficient insulation.

## Where can I park?

### Blue parking placards

Those assigned to the Tsongas Circle area can pickup BLUE "2024 Official Race
Vehicle Baystate Marathon" placards at the Tsongas Family Info table before you
park, or pick them up from Terry KA8SCP at the Rourke Bridge Unified Command Center
at [Bowlero Lowell, 647 Pawtucket Blvd, Lowell][ucc] after 6:30 AM.

### If you are stationed at Tsongas

Those at the Tsongas need to arrive early so you can navigate the traffic
barriers and get in to the volunteer parking lots. If for some reason you
cannot get to the volunteer lot and end up paying at one of the spectator lots,
keep your receipt and I'll reimburse you after the race. If you printed out the
blue dashboard placard I've emailed or you picked one up at the Family Info
table, you should be parking for FREE at [Lot B or Lot C (prefered)][parking].

### If you are stationed along the course

Parking will likely be available in the immediate vicinity of each water stop.

## Where can I pick up volunteer vests?

- **Tsongas Circle locations** – The Family Info table should have blue
volunteer vests. Feel free to bring your own if you have one. Please return
them to him at the Family Info table when you are clearing from your
participation. Most of you at the Tsongas Circle area will be winding down
between 2 and 3 PM. Remember you need to be parked and in the vicinity by 6:30
AM because roads will be shut down by 7 AM. Park in Lot B or C.

- **Water stop and course volunteers** - If you need vests and orange placards,
please stop at the foot of the Rourke Bridge in the Bowlero parking lot ([647
Pawtucket Blvd, Lowell MA 01854][ucc]) and pick them up. We will be there from
6:30 AM on.

## When should I arrive?

Those at the Tsongas need to arrive by 6:30 AM so you can navigate the traffic
barriers and get in to the volunteer parking lots.

Course volunteers, please plan on being at your location at least 20-30 minutes
before race start. Check in with the water stop team "lead" at your location
when you arrive.

## When do I leave?

Your operational period will depend on when the last of the runners have
cleared your position. We will advise the location of the end of race/sweep
vehicle is when we know its location.

Approximate runner location information is shown on Page 32 of the provided
public safety plan. There is a "sweep" vehicle that will be in the proximity of
the last runner's. NCS will pass that information along as we have it towards
the end of the race.
