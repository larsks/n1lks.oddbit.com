CAARA is always looking for ham volunteers to assist with the Race Safety Support program and with other Public Service Events that CAARA supports. Volunteering for these activities  is great training for emergency preparedness, it is social and fun, and it benefits the runners in races we support by providing a radio safety net and benefits other public activities such as parades and celebrations by assisting with safety of participants and event logistics.
