STARS is a club not only for adults, but for families and youth as well. STARS welcomes radio enthusiasts of all ages from New England and beyond. We meet both in Natick and on-line. Members include students, parents, mentors, and supportive individuals of all ages.  STARS is supported by [New England Sci-Tech][nest] (NEST) in Natick and is an affiliated club of the Amateur Radio Relay League (ARRL).
