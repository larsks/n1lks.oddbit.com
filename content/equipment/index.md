## At home

My primary radio is a [Kenmore TM-V71A][tm-v71a], attached via a [Digirig] to a Raspberry Pi for packet operation.

## In the field

When operating at a public service event for which I will need a mobile radio, I use a [Yaesu FTM-6000R][ftm] attached to an [Ed Fong DJB-2 roll-up j-pole antenna][djb-2] that I deploy using a tripod and a PVC mast.

## HTs

At events for which an HT is appropriate, I use a Radioddity [GD-77] running the [OpenGD77] firmware.
