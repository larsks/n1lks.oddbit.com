## At home

My primary radio is a [Kenwood TM-V71A], attached via a [Digirig] to a Raspberry Pi for packet operation. I have a [Yaesu FT-891] that I use occasionally for [POTA] activations.

## In the field

My typical setup for public service events is a Kenwood TM-V71A in my van configured as a repeater, while I wear an HT (with a [very small antenna](https://a.co/d/4bKmNXh)) on my chest. If I need to use the mobile radio and I can't use the van (either I'm stationed somewhere that I can't park, or if I bike to the event) I will use either:

- an [Ed Fong DBJ-2](https://edsantennas.weebly.com/) roll-up antenna, either strung up in a tree or mounted on a tripod and a PVC mast, or
- a tripod-mounted [Signal Staff](https://signalstuff.com/products/ss-osj/) collapsible opejn-stub j-pole antenna

## HTs

At events for which an HT is appropriate, I use a Radioddity [GD-77] running [OpenGD77] firmware. My "event kit" looks something like this:

- [Radioddity GD-77][gd-77]
- Spare battery
- [Signal Stick antenna][signalstick]
- [Commountain speaker mic]
- [Signal stick magnetic mount][magmount]
- [Battery eliminator]
- [Commountain earpiece]

I have two complete kits so that there's a backup of everything if something goes wrong.
