## At home

My primary radio is a [Kenmore TM-V71A][tm-v71a], attached via a [Digirig] to a Raspberry Pi for packet operation.

## In the field

When operating at a public service event for which I will need a mobile radio, I use a [Yaesu FTM-6000R][ftm] attached to an [Ed Fong DJB-2 roll-up j-pole antenna][djb-2] that I deploy using a tripod and a PVC mast.

## HTs

At events for which an HT is appropriate, I use a Radioddity [GD-77] running [OpenGD77] firmware. My "event kit" looks something like this:

- [Radioddity GD-77][gd-77]
- Spare battery
- [Signal Stick antenna][signalstick]
- [Commountain speaker mic]
- [Signal stick magnetic mount][magmount]
- [Battery eliminator]
- [Commountain earpiece]

I have two complete kits so that there's a backup of everything if something goes wrong.
