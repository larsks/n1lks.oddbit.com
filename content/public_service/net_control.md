title: Some thoughts on running a public event net

## Have an orientation meeting before the event

Host a video call before the event or an in-person meeting the day of the event in order to introduce yourself to your volunteer operators and to review communications procedures.

## Keep track of which stations have logged in

Stations should be instructed to check in well before the race. If you haven't heard from a station in a timely fashion after the check-in time, see if you can reach out via an alternate form of communication (e.g., text message or call).

## Perform an initial roll call before the event

Performs an explicit comms check before the event starts: call each station using their tactical callsign (and instruct the stations to reply with both their tactical callsign and their fcc callsign).

## Perform periodic roll calls during the event

Periodic roll calls help identify problems (dead batteries, volume knob got jostled) and provide everyone with confidence that comms are still working as expected.
