The Cycle for Shelter is Emmaus' signature fundraising event that raises money to support the organization's mission of providing emergency shelter, affordable housing, and services to those experiencing homelessness. The annual community cycling event features multiple route options (100-mile, 62-mile, 35-mile, 15-mile, and virtual rides) and brings together nearly 200 cyclists alongside dozens of local business sponsors to generate critical funding for Emmaus' programs serving homeless and impoverished families.
