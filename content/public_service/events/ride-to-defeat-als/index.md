The Ride to Defeat ALS is an annual community fundraising bicycle event held in Massachusetts, typically on September 20th, that brings together riders to support people affected by [ALS] (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis). The annual Massachusetts Ride to Defeat ALS is an opportunity for friends, family, and the local community to join together to support those people affected by ALS in Massachusetts, with funds raised at this event helping to discover treatments and a cure for ALS, to serve, advocate for, and empower those living with the disease.

Riders enjoy fully supported routes with rest stops, support vehicles, and a finish line celebration with entertainment and food, making it both a meaningful fundraiser and an enjoyable cycling experience that creates hope and action in the fight against this devastating neurodegenerative disease. The event offers multiple route options with turn-by-turn navigation through the RideWithGPS app, and registration fees vary throughout the year, with people living with ALS able to participate for free.
