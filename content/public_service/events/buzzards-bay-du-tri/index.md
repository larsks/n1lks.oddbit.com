This season-ending race provides an incredible backdrop for multisport racing on Buzzards Bay with picturesque views. The bike course is set in Westport, where youâ€™ll encounter farmhouses and cottages straight out of a Martha Stewart magazine. The run course finishes on the beach path set along the Bay/Ocean. Amateur radio volunteers are coordinated by the [Worcester Emergency Communications Team][wect].
