## My volunteer activities

I'm keeping a log of my public service activities [here](activities/).

## Public service opportunities

The following events have in the past asked for the help of amateur radio volunteers. Announcements are often made to the various club mailing lists when an event is actively looking for volunteer assistance.

- [BAA Boston Marathon][baa] in April

- [Cycle for Shelter](https://emmausinc.org/cycle-for-shelter-2/) in September

- [Baystate marathon][baystate] in October

  I have collected some information [here](baystate_marathon) for volunteers at the Baystate Marathon. Much of this material originated with Terry M. Stader, [KA8SCP], who helps organize amateur radio volunteer service at this event.

- [BAA Half Marathon][baahalf] in November

  I have collected some information about the BAA Half Marathon [here](baa_half_marathon).

- [Ocean View Half Marathon](https://www.yukanrun.com/oceanview-half-marathon-5k) in November (volunteer radio service organized by [CAARA])

- [Happy Holidays Half Marathon][hhh] in December (volunteer radio service organized by [CAARA])

  I have collected some information [here](happy_holidays_half_marathon) for amateur radio volunteers.
