## My volunteer activities

I'm keeping a log of my public service activities [here](activities/).

## Public service opportunities

- [BAA Boston Marathon](https://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon/volunteer) in April

  This is the largest amateur radio volunteer opportunity in the region. There were almost 300 volunteer radio operators in 2025.

- [Cycle for Shelter](https://emmausinc.org/cycle-for-shelter-2/) in September

- The [Ride to Defeat ALS](https://www.als.org/massachusetts-ch/events/ride-defeat-als-massachusetts) in September

- [Baystate marathon](https://www.baystatemarathon.com/) in October

  I have collected some information [here](baystate_marathon) for volunteers at the Baystate Marathon. Much of this material originated with Terry M. Stader, [KA8SCP], who helps organize amateur radio volunteer service at this event.

- [Head of the Charles Regatta](https://hocr.org/) in October

- [BAA Half Marathon](https://www.baa.org/races/boston-half) in November

  I have collected some information about the BAA Half Marathon [here](baa_half_marathon).

- The [Cape Anne Amateur Radio Association](https://caara.net/main/) provides [race support](https://sites.google.com/view/caararaces/home) for a number of events between May and December (primarily half marathons around Cape Ann).

  The CAARA "[Guidelines for Volunteers]" document is good reading if you're interested in participating.
