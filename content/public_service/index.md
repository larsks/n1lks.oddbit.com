## Public service opportunities

The following events have in the past asked for the help of amateur radio volunteers. Announcements are often made to the various club mailing lists when an event is actively looking for volunteer assistance.

- [BAA Boston Marathon](https://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon/volunteer) and [Half Marathon](https://www.baa.org/races/baa-half-marathon/volunteer)
- [Baystate marathon](https://www.baystatemarathon.com/)

  Terry M. Stader, [KA8SCP], helps organize amateur radio volunteer service at the Baystate Marathon. He has put together a [collection of helpful information](baystate_marathon) for volunteers.
