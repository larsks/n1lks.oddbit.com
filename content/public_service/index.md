## My volunteer activities

- September 2024 [Cycle for
  Shelter](https://give.emmausinc.org/event/2024-cycle-for-shelter/e570321).

  I was stationed at the [Boxford Second Congregational Church][boxford]. You can see a few photos of my station
  [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/BknbK9RmPYQ6ZwGP6). I've put together a map of the courses and rest stops [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1AVcfy-LazXzyhn2wXhymyljLHbaF0zA&usp=sharing).

- October 2024 [Baystate Marathon][baystate]

  I was stationed at medical tent 1A along with Tim Carter [K1DC]. Our job was to record the bib numbers of runners coming in for medical care so that we could provide those to the family info table if someone dropped by looking for their people.

- November 2024 [BAA Half Marathon][baahalf]

  Up at 4:30 in the morning for a 5am bike ride from Belmont to Franklin Park. It was a chilly 30Â°F when I left, but warmed up later in the day. I was at water station 7, just outside the start/finish line. Other than checking in, checking out, and roll call, there wasn't much to do on the radio so I spent my time helping the water volunteers fill cups, clean up, etc. 

  You can find some pictures from the event [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/oQaxifhZ3dft7wwy6).

- December 2024 [Happy Holidays Half Marathon][hhh]

  I was stationed at Checkpoint 1, the intersection of Thatcher Rd and Farm Lane (some sort of private drive).

  It's a good thing I packed my TM-V71A, because I was just a bit too far away from the repeater for the HT. I set up the mobile as a cross-band repeater and it worked great.

## Public service opportunities

The following events have in the past asked for the help of amateur radio volunteers. Announcements are often made to the various club mailing lists when an event is actively looking for volunteer assistance.

  I have collected some information [here](baystate_marathon) for volunteers at the Baystate Marathon. Much of this material originated with Terry M. Stader, [KA8SCP], who helps organize amateur radio volunteer service at this event.
