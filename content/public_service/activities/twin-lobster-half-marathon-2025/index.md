I was stationed at checkpoint 3 near the intersection of Eastern Pt. Rd. & Grapevine Rd. in Gloucester, MA. This was right by the ocean and there was a constant onshore breeze, so I ended up setting up a camping chair inside my van where I would have a little shelter. The view from here was gorgeous; you can find photos from the event [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/7Wpukyt1nsvBrXeZ8).
