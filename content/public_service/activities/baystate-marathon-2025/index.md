This is my second year working at the Baystate marathon. It looks like they're expecting just about 2500 runners this year. Last year I was stationed at one of the medical tents at the Tsongas center. This year I was stationed out on the course at [water stop #6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/68SApMVMaqHZgn5d8), along the Merrimack River and across from American Legion post 247 in Tyngsborough.
