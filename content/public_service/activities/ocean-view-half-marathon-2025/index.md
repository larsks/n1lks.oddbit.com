The Ocean View Half Marathon runs through Ipswich and around Great Neck. This
year I was stationed at [checkpoint 3], at the intersection of East St &
Jeffrey's Neck Rd. These checkpoints that are in the middle of residential
areas aren't my favorites, because it's not always clear where I can park and
set up my station.
