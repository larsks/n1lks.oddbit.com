I was stationed at checkpoint 5 near the intersection of [Chebacco Rd. and Essex St.][cp5] I have put together a [course map with checkpoint locations]. This wasn't as scenic as some other locations; Essex St. is relatively busy. Joe the Hamilton police officer closed down one side of the road to help keep runners safe.
