The Happy Holidays Half Marathon (aka Merrithon) is the last half marathon of the season supported by CAARA. For this event, I'm going to be shadowing Net Control, rather than working at a checkpoint, with the ultimate goal of sharing the Net Control role at some point next year.

I used [QGIS] to create a [custom map] of the course.
