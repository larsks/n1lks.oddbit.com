I was stationed at Checkpoint 2 near the corner of Essex Rd. and Northgate Rd. in Ipswich, MA. You can see checkpoint locations on [my map] of the event. You can find a small number of photos [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/d1wodzUGe1R91nWj7). I parked at the lot for the [Castle Neck River Reservation], part of the [Greenbelt].
